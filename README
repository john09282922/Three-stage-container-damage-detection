Title: Three Stage Container Damage Detection Algorithms
for Real Scenario

Abstract: The detection of damaged containers is a critical 
concern in the evolving era of smart ports. A three-stage 
approach to container damage detection is proposed to 
proactively mitigate potential risks to the container business. In 
the initial "In-Gate" process, the system identifies damages using 
truck and container information, informing users about critical 
damages that could impact loading onto cargo ships. 
Subsequently, this information is stored on a server. Similarly, 
during the "Out-Gate" process, the system identifies container ID 
and damages, allowing a server-based algorithm to compare 
carried-in and carried-out container conditions. This comparison 
helps assess whether additional damage occurred during 
shipment. Rigorous real-world testing verifies the system's 
efficacy, showcasing its superiority in detecting even minor 
containers through recent object detection models. This approach 
presents a novel solution for managing container damage in port 
environments. In real scenario, we establish container ID
detection AP is 0.656, container detection AP is 0.908, container 
damage detection AP is 0.512, considering real environment.
